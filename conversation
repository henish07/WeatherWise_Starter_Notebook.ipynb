User: How can I fetch weather data for a location using fetch-my-weather?

AI: Use WeatherWrapper from fetch_my_weather. Here's a sample:

from fetch_my_weather import WeatherWrapper
weather = WeatherWrapper()
data = weather.get_weather('Port Louis')
print(data)

User: Can you help me format the data to show the forecast for the next two days?

AI: Sure! You can access the 'days' key in the data dictionary and loop through the first two days...

User: Thanks! This helped me fetch and display weather data in my app.
